Fine-tuned a BART-base model on the ASLG-PC12 dataset for English-to-ASL Gloss translation,
optimizing training on Google Colab (T4 GPU) and achieving a validation BLEU score of ~48.
Developed a Python application with YouTube and direct text input, integrating regex-based text
cleaning to preprocess data for the NLP model.
Engineered a heuristic system to parse generated glosses and visually render fingerspelled
components using ASL alphabet images, displayed sequentially in a user interface (Tkinter/Flask).
Successfully debugged and resolved issues related to model output formatting, domain mismatch
between training data and real-world inputs, and GUI image rendering.
